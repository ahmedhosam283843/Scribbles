# NoteApp
This is a simple Note Application that uses Jetpack Compose for the user interface. The app allows you to create, read, update, and delete notes, as well as search for notes.

## Architecture
This app is built with Jetpack Compose, which is a modern toolkit for building Android UI. Jetpack Compose allows for a more declarative and reactive approach to building UI, making it easier to create dynamic and responsive UIs.

The app is structured with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. This pattern separates the UI logic (View) from the data and business logic (Model), and introduces the ViewModel as an intermediary between the two.

## Features

- Create notes: Users can create new notes by entering a title, a description, and selecting a color.
- Read notes: Users can view all notes in a list, and select a note to view its details.
- Update notes: Users can edit the title, description, and color of a note.
- Delete notes: Users can delete a note by swiping it in the list.
- Order notes: Users can order notes by title, date, or color by selecting the corresponding option in the app bar menu.
